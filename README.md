ASCII Games for the Terminal

## 🌟 About
I created **asciigamest** as a collection of games made entirely with ASCII.  
This project is my tribute to old-school retro gaming in the terminal.  

No graphics engine. No GPU.  
Just text, imagination, and pure fun.  

## 🚀 Features
- 100% ASCII graphics – runs in CMD, Bash, or any console.  
- Lightweight – every game is just a few KB.  
- Offline friendly – once downloaded, no internet is required.  
- Open for everyone to contribute new ASCII games.  

## 🎲 Games included (or planned)
- 🐍 Snake (classic)  
- 🧱 Pong  
- 🚀 Space Invaders (ASCII style)  
- 🎲 Dice & Guess number  
- 🧑‍🚀 Among Us ASCII parody
